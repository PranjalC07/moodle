        The `core:e/text_highlight` and `core:e/text_highlight_picker` icons are
        deprecated and will be removed in Moodle 6.0.
        The UX team recommended this change to reduce visual clutter and improve
        readability. The icons were removed because they didn't indicate status
        changes, were repetitive across all notifications, and took up space that
        could be used for more content.
      type: deprecated
