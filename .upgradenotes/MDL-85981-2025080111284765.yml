notes:
  core_courseformat:
    - message: >-
        Added new `core_courseformat\output\local\overview\overviewaction`
        output class to create action buttons that now include a badge right
        next to the button text.
        It essentially extends the existing action_link class to add a badge,
        making important actions stand out more on the course overview.
        Plus, this new structure also makes these badged action links easier
        to export this information for web services.
      type: improved
