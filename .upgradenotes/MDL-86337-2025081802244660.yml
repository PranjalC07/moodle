  core_courseformat:
    - message: >-
        The `core_course\output\activitychooserbutton` has been moved to
        `core_courseformat\output\local\activitychooserbutton` . From now on,
        format plugins can provide alternative outputs for this element. Also,
        all the javascript and templates related to the activity chooser are now
        located inside the core_courseformat subsystem.
      type: improved
    - message: >-
        All activity chooser related code has been moved to the
        `core_courseformat` subsystem. This includes all templates,
        javascript, and the main output class. If your theme overrides any
        of these, you will need to update your code accordingly.
